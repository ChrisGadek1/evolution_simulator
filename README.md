# The Evolution Simulator
I am pleased to introduce my project made for the OOP course. It's name is "The Evolution Simulator".

# How to open it?
To open my project, you need to __load Google GSON library__, which was used to parse a JSON file to a Java object. If you use the IntelIJ, you can clone my project with dependencies by one click.

# How to use it?
The GUI of The project was coded in polish language (screenshot 1). On the map, red dots represents animals, lightgreen squares represents grass. The dark green rectangle represents jungle. Despite obvious controlls, like Buttons "Start", or "Pauza", the GUI contains also "genom" Button, that colors on darkblue every animal with dominated genome.

Clicking on the animal triggers new Panel, where the user can see the genome of the clicked animal and has a little interface to follow this animal in the future.

More red animal mean, that it has more energy. White animal has energy on level 1 and dies if doesn't eat any grass during next day.

Initial parameters are saved in __parameters.json__ file and can be modified
